Your AI-powered task management system that keeps you focused on what matters.

## About

Claude Code for PMM is an AI-powered task management system designed specifically for Technical Product Marketing Managers. Brain dump into `BACKLOG.md`, tell your AI assistant to process it, and get organized tasks automatically prioritized based on your goals.

Built on [PersonalOS](https://github.com/amanaiproduct/personal-os) and customized for TPMM workflows, this system includes:

- **TPMM-specific categories** - sales-enablement, gtm, devrel, competitive, launch
- **Specialized workflows** - launch planning, sales enablement, competitive analysis
- **Product context capture** - setup captures your company, product, and work schedule preferences
- **Knowledge base structure** - optimized folders for competitive intel, customer stories, sales collateral, and more

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chriscooning/claude-code-for-pmm.git
cd claude-code-for-pmm
```

### 2. Run Setup (2 minutes)

**Windows:**
```batch
setup.bat
```

Or directly with PowerShell:
```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
./setup.sh
```

The setup will:
- Create your workspace directories
- Guide you through questions about your goals, priorities, product context, and work schedule
- Generate your personalized GOALS.md
- Copy template files

**Windows Users - Execution Policy:**
If you encounter an execution policy error when running `setup.bat`, you may need to allow PowerShell scripts to run. Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Or for a one-time bypass (current session only):
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```

**Note:** Python 3.10+ is only needed if you want to run the MCP server. The basic setup works with just PowerShell (Windows) or bash (Mac/Linux).

### 3. Start Using It
```
# In your AI assistant (Claude Code, etc.)
"Read AGENTS.md and help me get organized"
```

## How It Works

1. **Brain dump** - Drop notes into `BACKLOG.md` (no structure needed)
2. **Process** - Say "process my backlog" to your AI
3. **Get organized** - AI creates prioritized tasks based on your GOALS.md
4. **Stay focused** - Ask "what should I work on?" for smart suggestions

### Common Commands

- `"Process my backlog"` - Turn notes into tasks
- `"What should I work on?"` - Get AI suggestions
- `"Show me my P0 tasks"` - See urgent items
- `"Mark [task] as done"` - Complete work

### Priorities

| Priority | Meaning | Limit |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **P0** | Do today | max 3 |
| **P1** | This week | max 7 |
| **P2** | Scheduled | - |
| **P3** | Someday/maybe | - |

## Daily Workflow

**Morning:** `"Show me today's priorities"` → Pick 1-3 tasks

**During work:** Brain dump into BACKLOG.md, save docs to Knowledge/

**End of day:** `"Mark [task] as done"`

**Weekly:** `"Process my backlog"` + `"Clean up old tasks"`

## Features

- Goal-driven prioritization based on your vision
- Smart deduplication detects duplicate tasks
- Natural language - just talk to your AI
- Session evals to review and learn from AI interactions
- 2-minute setup, no Python required
- MCP integration for Claude and other AI assistants

## Troubleshooting

### Windows Setup Issues

**Execution Policy Errors:**
If you see "execution of scripts is disabled" when running `setup.bat`:
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
3. Try running `setup.bat` again

**PowerShell Not Found:**
- Ensure PowerShell 5.1 or later is installed
- Download from: https://aka.ms/powershell
- Or use Windows PowerShell (pre-installed on Windows 10/11)

**Alternative Methods for Windows:**
- Use Git Bash: Right-click folder → "Git Bash Here" → `./setup.sh`
- Use WSL: Open WSL terminal → navigate to project → `./setup.sh`

### Mac/Linux Setup Issues

**Permission Denied:**
If you see "Permission denied" when running `./setup.sh`:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

**Bash Not Found:**
- Most Mac/Linux systems have bash pre-installed
- If missing, install via your package manager
