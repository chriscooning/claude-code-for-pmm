# Launch Plans

Launch checklists, timelines, and launch planning documents.

## Structure
- `launch-[product-name]-[date].md` - Individual launch plans
- `launch-checklist-template.md` - Reusable checklist template
- `post-launch-review-[date].md` - Post-launch retrospectives

## Usage

When planning launches:
1. Create a new launch plan file
2. Use checklist template as starting point
3. Track progress and dependencies
4. Document learnings in post-launch reviews
